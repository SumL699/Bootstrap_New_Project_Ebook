                                        Your experience as you look at the woman’s face seamlessly combines what
                                        we normally call seeing and intuitive thinking. As surely and quickly as you
                                        saw that the young woman’s hair is dark, you knew she is angry.
                                        Furthermore, what you saw extended into the future. You sensed that this
                                        woman is about to say some very unkind words, probably in a loud and
                                        strident voice. A premonition of what she was going to do next came to
                                        mind automatically and effortlessly. You did not intend to assess her mood
                                        or to anticipate what she might do, and your reaction to the picture did not
                                        have the feel of something you did. It just happened to you. It was an
                                        instance of fast thinking.

                                        is strictly necessary. As a consequence, the thoughts and actions that
                                        System 2 believes it has chosen are often guided by the figure at the center
                                        of the story, System 1. However, there are vital tasks that only System 2 can
                                        perform because they require effort and acts of self-control in which the
                                        intuitions and impulses of System 1 are overcome.

                                    This is a fascinating book. Reading this book means not having to read so many others. For example, you could avoid having to read, Sway, Blink, Nudge and probably a dozen or so other books on Behavioural Economics. And the best part of it is that this is the guy (or, at least one half of the two guys) who came up with these ideas in the first place.

                                        In the last few years two books took me FOREVER to get through. The first was Daniel Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" and the second is Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow." What caused this? What do they have in common? Both books explain, in minute detail, simple concepts with immensely far-reaching implications, and both have been... after the slog... the most intellectually rewarding reading of my adult life.                        </p>

                                        An unrelentingly tedious book that can be summed up as follows. We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. Life not only is uncertain, we cannot understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. Above all, determine the baseline before you come to any decisions.                       </p>
